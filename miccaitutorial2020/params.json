{"name":"RadxTools: novel informatics tools for tumor response assessment via imaging","tagline":"","body":"## RadxTools is a new image informatics toolkit funded through the NCI ITCR program, under 1U01CA248226-01.\r\n\r\n### Tools released\r\n[CoLlAGe](https://github.com/radxtools/collageradiomics): a new radiomics descriptor which captures subtle anisotropic differences in disease pathologies by measuring entropy of co-occurrences of voxel-level gradient orientations on imaging computed within a local neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe PIs of the RadxTools project are [Pallavi Tiwari](https://www.bric-lab.com) and [Satish E. Viswanath](https://engineering.case.edu/groups/inventlab/).\r\nThis U01 is a collaborative effort enabled by the [Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics at Case Western Reserve University](http://ccipd.case.edu).\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nPlease contact us at radxtools@case.edu with comments, suggestions, or concerns.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
